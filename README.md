Requirements
------------

[Java JDK 8](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases)

**Use the `.msi` installer if you are unsure how to manually set environment variables.**

Either the `JAVA_HOME` env variable must be set to the home directory of JDK,

or the JDK bin directory must be set in `PATH`.

Instructions
------------

1. Use the `compile_all.cmd` file to compile the `bot.jar` client and the included scripts (Windows OS).

2. The bot may be started by double-clicking `bot.jar` or using the `run.cmd` file.

Alternatively, use `ant` on the command-line/terminal to compile and run the client (Windows/Unix OS).

You can also run the client via cli using `java -jar bot.jar`

In-game Commands
--------------

* `::roofs` Show/hide roofs
* `::menu` Show/hide combat style menu
* `::debug` Show/hide npc/object/wall/item ids

Keyboard stuff
--------------

* Arrow Keys - Camera (hold shift to free-roam).
* Middle Mouse Button - Rotate camera.
* Escape - Resets the camera.
* F12 - Takes a screenshot, saves it to the screenshots directory.
* Ctrl+V - Paste text into the chat.

Using custom fonts
------------------

Edit bot.properties and add the following line:

```
font=Comic Neue
```

with "Comic Neue" replaced with the font you want to use. Unless you want to use Comic Neue.

RSC by default tries to use Helvetica/Arial, but can't if you don't have it installed.

Using command line arguments
------------------

Execute the bot passing in the arguments below. An account must already be setup and added to the bot
before using the auto launch --username: parameter.

```
--no-console		Launches the bot without console
--username:username	Default account name for launcher. Must already be added as account.
--height:558		Also: --h. Window height. Height and Width must both be set together.
--width:670			Also: --w. Window width. Height and Width must both be set together.
--x:200				X Location on screen. X and Y must both be set together.
--y:200				Y Location on screen. X and Y must both be set together.
```
